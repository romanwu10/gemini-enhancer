# Gemini Enhancer

A Chrome extension that enhances your experience with AI chat interfaces like Gemini by providing follow-up capabilities and custom slash commands. Features automatic dark/light theme support that syncs with your system preferences.

**Updated to Manifest V3** for continued Chrome support through 2025 and beyond.

v1.7: Polished native-feel UI, improved reliability (no duplicate injections on SPA navigations), accessible slash command dropdown (ARIA roles, keyboard-friendly), non-blocking toasts instead of alerts, autosave on tab hide, and robust dark/light styling (removed unsupported light-dark()).

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI & Theme Support
- **Automatic Theme Detection**: Seamlessly switches between light and dark modes based on your system preferences
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, smooth animations, and a polished interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes and browser zoom levels
 - **Native Feel**: Controls use Chrome/Gemini-like spacing, shadows, and focus rings

### 1. Follow-up Helper
- Select any text on Gemini
- Choose from three action buttons that appear: "Ask about this", "Explain further", or "Give examples"
- Each button automatically generates an appropriate prompt and inserts it into the chat input
- No more manual typing - just select text and click your preferred action!

### 2. Slash Commands
Create custom shortcuts for frequently used prompts! Type `/` followed by your command name to quickly insert predefined prompts.

#### Default Commands
The extension comes with useful default commands:

- `/translate` - Translate text to English
- `/explain` - Explain concepts in simple terms
